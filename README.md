- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LucieB-coder !
I'm a french hischooler. 
Next year I will go to college, and right now I'm waiting for answers of the schools I've asked for, wich is kind of stressful.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in new technologies, AI, robotic, ect... I enjoy coding and seing a project grow up to become the best it cans.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning informatic, by myself... 
I don't know a lot about coding, but I'm doing my best to understand informatic languages, why they've been created, what command means what, how a repo works,ect...
I really want to learn more about technologies and coding, and if I'm accepted in the formation I want, I will make it my job.

With the hope that the person reading this is having a good day, goodbye
